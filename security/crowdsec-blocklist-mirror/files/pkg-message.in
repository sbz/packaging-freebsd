crowdsec-blocklist-mirror is installed.

If you are running crowdsec on this machine, the bouncer will register itself with
the Local API when it's started the first time.

If the LAPI is on another machine, you need to manually register the bouncer
and fill lapi_key and lapi_url in %%ETCDIR%%/crowdsec-blocklist-mirror.yaml before
starting the service.

Then activate the bouncer via sysrc and run it:

----------
# sysrc crowdsec_mirror_enable="YES"
crowdsec_mirror_enable: NO -> YES
# service crowdsec_mirror start
----------
